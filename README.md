# cardHappeningLegacySite
The Legacy eCommerce site for Card Happening.
This site is currently hosted in its legacy form at www.botfever.com

Developed using a custom LAMP stack.

The first part of this site, the consumer facing side, was developed in a procedural style.

The second part of this site, the Retailer facing side which can be found in the 'retailer' folder was developed in an object oriented style.

This site was developed in 2014 and was my first major project taking me roughly 3 months to accomplish. At the time I developed this site I had not been exposed to programming paradigms, data structures, or algorithms. 

Given this, there is some messy code in this site and some silly mistakes.

For instance, many of the javascript files are in .php extenstions and loaded inline rather then being loaded as scripts. This was done in order to load values into some JavaScript objects from a database. In hindsight, I would have accomplished this through AJAX to an API.

I learned invaluable lessons during this project.
